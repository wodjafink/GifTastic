# Want some delicious gifs served up to your specification??

I've added a list of my favorite foods:

* Burgers, because who doesn't like a tasty burger!

* Burritos, the perfect food (Mine usually has Al Pastor in it)

* Chow Mein, gotta love those delicious chinese noodles

* Sushi, because, as David said in class, everyone loves sushi (except when it makes you sick)

* Pizza.  Need I say more?

Any time you press these given foods, you'll see a magical array of gifs appear!  But they require a click to play.  Click again to stop the madness!!

What if there's a favorite food if you like that isn't on this list??  Worry not, friend, because you can add it using the form to the left!  Simply type in the name of your food, such as tacos (Which didn't make the short list sadly), press submit, and you'll be rewarded with a new snack button!!
